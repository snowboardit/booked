## Data

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **This list is by no means current or complete!**

To get started, I asked GPT-4 to produce a list of all the programming and database languages, omitting those that are obscure and rarely used. GPT-4 isn't perfect and neither am I, so the data requires validation before being considered a reliable source. Validated languages are being tracked [here](https://github.com/snowboardit/reserved/issues/4).

The data file is located [here](https://github.com/snowboardit/reserved/edit/master/pkg/data/data.json): `pkg/data/data.json`

Please feel free to contribute to the data to include missing information, or new languages and words. Learn more in the [contributing](#contributing) section below.
